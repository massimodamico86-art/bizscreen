## Accumulated Context

### Key Research Insights

- Polotno runs in an isolated React 18 iframe -- stock asset panels MUST be built inside the iframe, not bridged via postMessage
- `unsplash-js` npm package is archived -- use raw HTTP fetch to Unsplash REST API
- Unsplash API has 4 mandatory compliance requirements: attribution with UTM, hotlinking CDN, download tracking endpoint, no re-hosting
- Existing Framer Motion (12.x) and Lucide React (0.548+) cover all animation and icon needs -- zero new dependencies
- Unsplash hotlinking vs offline player conflict needs resolution during Phase 46

### Decisions

- [46-01] Database-backed cache over Redis/Upstash -- avoids external dependency, PostgreSQL already available in Edge Functions
- [46-01] Hourly window rate limiting (date_trunc) over sliding window -- simpler, adequate for per-tenant throttling
- [46-01] Graceful degradation: rate limit check failures and download tracking errors do not block user requests

### Blockers/Concerns

- Unsplash offline caching question: TOS may conflict with offline player requirement. Needs clarification before Phase 46 implementation.
