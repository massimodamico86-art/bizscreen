## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Stabilize before new features - logic gaps pose production risk
- [Init]: Full refactoring approved - large components block maintenance
- [Init]: Comprehensive scope selected - all 4 Phase 2 features included

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No test coverage in src/ - all refactoring is high-risk until Phase 1 completes
- 197+ console.log calls - observability limited until Phase 4 completes
